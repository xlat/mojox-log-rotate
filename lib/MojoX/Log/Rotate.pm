=head1 NAME

MojoX::Log::Rotate - Easy log rotation for Mojolicious

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use MojoX::Log::Rotate;
  my $log = MojoX::Log::Rotate->new( path => 'test.log', frequency => 3600 );
  $app->log($log); #replace the application logger

  # implement a custom rotation behaviour
  my $log = MojoX::Log::Rotate->new( path => 'test.log', how => \&how_to, when => \&when_to);

  sub when_to ($log) {
    # rotate log every 1Mb
    if($log->handle->tell > 1_000_000) {
      return {
        size => $log->handle->tell
      }
    }
    return 0;
  }

  sub how_to ($log, $when_res) {
    # implement your custom log rotation here, or just let's use the default callback
    # you don't even need to specify C<how> parameter in the L</"new"> constructor.
    $log->default_rotation_cb($when_res);
  }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<MojoX::Log::Rotate> is a simple extension to L<Mojo::Log> that make file log rotation easy.
The default rotation handlers rotate log file based on a "frequency" parameter. It does not create empty rotated file.

=head1 EVENTS

L<MojoX::Log::Rotate> inherites all events from L<Mojo::Log> and can emit the following one.

=head2 rotate

  $log->on(rotate => sub ($log, $params) {
    $log->info("log file $params->{how}{rotated_file} created");
  });

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

L<MojoX::Log::Rotate> implements the following attributes.

=head2 need_rotate_cb

  my $cb = $log->need_rotate_cb;
  $log->need_rotate_cb(sub ($log){ ... });

A callback called on message event, if it returns a true value the L</"rotate_cb"> will be called with the return value.
It's role is provide the rules to trigger a log rotation.

=head2 rotate_cb

  my $cb = $log->rotate_cb;
  $log->rotate_cb(sub ($log, $need_rotate_result){ ... });

It's role is to provide the log rotation mechanism.
It receives at second argument the value returned by L</"need_rotate_cb">.

=head2 last_rotate

  my $last = $log->last_rotate;
  $log->last_rotate( time );

With the default behaviour it represent the last time a rotation was done.

=head2 frequency

  my $frequency = $log->frequency;
  #set log rotation frequency to 1 hour
  $log->frequency(3600); 

The frequency used in the default behaviour to rotate log, exprimed in seconds.

=head1 METHODS

L<MojoX::Log::Rotate> inherits all methods from L<Mojo::Log> and implements the following new one.

=head2 new

  my $log = MojoX::Log::Rotate->new;
  my $log = MojoX::Log::Rotate->new(path => 'app.log');

  my $log = MojoX::Log::Rotate->new(frequency => 3600);

  my $log = MojoX::Log::Rotate->new(when => sub($log){...}, how => sub($log,$r){...});

The constructor inherits from L<Mojo::Log> constructor and accepts the following additional parameters. 

=head3 when

  Specify the L</"need_rotate_cb"> attribute callback.

=head3 how

  Specify the L</"rotate_cb"> attribute callback.

=head3 frequency

  Set the L</"frequency"> attribute.

=head1 DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR

The default behaviour is to rotate the log file based on the node creation time attribute (stat() 10th returned value)
of the filename returned by L</"path">. It append the suffix pattern _YYYYMMDD_hhmmss just before the extension.

=head1 LIMITATION

Does not works with call to L</"append"> method or any direct access to the underlying file handle.
